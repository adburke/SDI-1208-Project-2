==================

Project 2

Notes:

Boolean Logic:
Your project requires some kind of Boolean expression. It doesn't need to be ridiculously complex, but it should show that you understand the concepts here. At a bare minimum, your project should use two of the three logical operators JavaScript offers.

Loops:
For your project you'll need to include the first two forms: while and for. Keep in mind that the main difference between them is whether you know how many times you need to run the loop beforehand, or whether you need to just run until something happens. But either syntax can always be rewritten to the other, as they follow the same steps.
