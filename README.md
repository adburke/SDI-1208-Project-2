==================

Project 2

Notes:

Boolean Logic:
Your project requires some kind of Boolean expression. It doesn't need to be ridiculously complex, but it should show that you understand the concepts here. At a bare minimum, your project should use two of the three logical operators JavaScript offers.

Loops:
For your project you'll need to include the first two forms: while and for. Keep in mind that the main difference between them is whether you know how many times you need to run the loop beforehand, or whether you need to just run until something happens. But either syntax can always be rewritten to the other, as they follow the same steps.

Arrays:
For your project you'll need to loop over an array and perform some kind of math or other logical function on the items in the array. For example, you could sum the values in the array, find an average or the minimum or maximum, count the occurances of a specific item, or all of the numbers greater or lesser than the item.

Functions:
Your project requires five functions:

One function that doesn't return a value (a procedure).
One function that takes two arguments and does some kind of Boolean comparison between them. The data type of the arguments doesn't matter for this function.
One function that does something interesting with strings, after taking two strings as arguments. This can be simple concatenation, but you are encouraged to look into other, more interesting string applications.
One function that takes a single number and uses it in a while loop somehow, doing some math at the same time. This can be something simple like counting or summing, but again you are encouraged to look into more interesting applications.
One function that takes an array and a number and uses them in a for loop of some kind. This should not be a simple index dereference (looking up one value by its index). Make it something more interesting.

Since four of those functions return values, you should do something interesting with the values when you get them back. You are encouraged, but not required, to use the return values from earlier functions as the inputs for later functions. You'll need this for Project 3, so it's something you should get comfortable with now.
